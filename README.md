You might have to zoom out browser to 90% to see full screen with upgrades.

Also if you know how to get the little towers to show up like all the other upgrades have, you can tell me if you want on discord, my username is "dmk1282#3954"
Cant get little burgers to show up lol.

ISSUE!! Importing saves does not work and i do not know why! but if you just press import, it will load that save the next time on the website, so thats a work around. lol, goess this just means no cheating.


This Idea was inspired by this chrome webstore app: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-clicker-extended/mefkpmhgfljflbldannlgahlmhagdcoe

WARNING!! This app may have stuff in its code that might mess with your privacy or something! proceed to install with caution if checking it out!
Also if you do check out this app/extension, it only works on classic cookie clicker on the "http://" version of the site! not https.
